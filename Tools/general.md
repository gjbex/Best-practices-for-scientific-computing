# Programming language-agnostic tools

This is a list of tools that are not specific to a specific
programming language.


## Version control

* [git](https://git-scm.com/): version control software.
* [SmartGit](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/): nice git GUI
  application that is cross-platform (Windows/MacOS/Linux) and can be used
  with multiple hosting services.
* [DVC](https://dvc.org/): Data Version Control, tool to manage versions of
  your data alongside your code.  Using this tool avoid having to commit
  large files into a git repository for which it is not intended.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) hosting platform.
* [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) hosting platform.
