# Tools for Python programming


## Code formatting

* [Black](https://github.com/psf/black): code formatter for Python (very
  opinionated).


## Linting and static analysis

* [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/): tool to enforce adherence
  to the Python style guide.
* [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/): if your code has type annotations, mypy
  will check for correctness.
* [pylint](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint): static code analyzer that
  also checks for documentation and style.


## Package managers

* [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html): Python package
  manager.
* [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba): Python package manager.
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): environment management, build and
  deployment of Python projects.


## Configuration files

* [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/): configuration management tool that allows you to
  compose complex configurations from simple pieces.


## Testing

* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/): unit testing framework.
* [hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/): property-based testing for
  Python, it also allows for fuzz testing.


## Profiling

* [CProfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html) is a profiler that
  is part of Python's standard library.
* [snakeviz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/) is a viewer for cProfile
  output.
* [line_profiler](https://github.com/pyutils/line_profiler) is a line-by-line
  profiler.
* [memory_profiler](https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/) is a memory
  profiler, it allows how much memory is used line-by-line in your code.


## Language interoperability

* [Cython](https://cython.org/): a superset of Python that allows you to write
  C extensions for Python.
* [Pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/): a header-only library that
    exposes C++ types in Python.
* [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/): a tool that generates C++ wrappers for
  Python.
* [Scikit-build](https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/): a build system generator
  for CMake that allows you to build C++ extensions for Python.
* [F2PY3](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/): a tool that allows you to wrap
  Fortran code for Python.


## Build tools

* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): environment management, build and
  deployment of Python projects.
