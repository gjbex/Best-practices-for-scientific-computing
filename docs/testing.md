# Testing

Testing your software is an essential part of the development process.  It is
important to have tests in place before you start optimizing or rewriting your
code. The following sections deal with specific aspects of testing and types of
tests:

* [testing as experiments](testing/testing_as_experiments.md);
* [unit testing](testing/unit_testing.md);
* [functional testing](testing/functional_testing.md);
* [code coverage](testing/code_coverage.md).
