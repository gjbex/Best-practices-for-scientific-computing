# Version control

Version control is a very important aspect of software development.  In short,
it allows to answer the following questions.

  * What was changed?
  * When was it changed?
  * Who made the change?
  * Why was the change made?

Using a version control system you can compare versions of your code, and if
necessary, revert to a previous version.

It is good practice to host you repositories on a service such as
[GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) or a hosting service
provided by your organization.  These environments all facilitate collaboration
on software projects and make it easy to work in teams.

You can find a PowerPoint presentation that introduces git and hosting services
in the training materials repository for [Version control with
git](https://gjbex.github.io/Version-control-with-git/).
