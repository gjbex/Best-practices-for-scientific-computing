# Best practices in programming

Material for a training on best practices for programming and software
development.


## Programming languages

Although this training aims to be programming language-agnostic, the repository
also list a number of tools that are programming language-specific.
Obviously, this can not be exhaustive, so feel free to suggest additonal
tools if you are aware of any.

Programming languages covered:

  * C
  * C++
  * Fortran
  * Python
  * R
