Material for a training on best practices for programming and software
development.

The material is available as a [website](https://gjbex.github.io/Best-practices-in-programming/).


## Table of contents

## Programming languages covered

Although this training aims to be programming language-agnostic, the repository
also list a number of tools that are programming language-specific.
Obviously, this can not be exhaustive, so feel free to suggest additional
tools if you are aware of any.

Programming languages covered:

* C
* C++
* Fortran
* Python
* R

Of course, there are many programming language-agnostic tools as well.

I've "borrowed" much of the table of contents from a

the Netherlands eScience Center, although no actual contents of that
training was used for the development of this material.
