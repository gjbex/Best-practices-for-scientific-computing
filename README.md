# Best practices in programming

Material for a training on best practices for programming and software
development.

Although this training aims to be programming language-agnostic, the repository
also list a number of tools that are programming language-specific.
Obviously, this can not be exhaustive, so feel free to suggest additonal
tools if you are aware of any.

Programming languages covered:
* C
* [C++](Tools/C-plus-plus.md)
* [Fortran](Tools/Fortran.md)
* [Python](Tools/Python.md)
* [R](Tools/R.md)
* Julia

Of course, there are many
[programming language-agnostic tools](Tools/general.md) as well.

I've "borrowed" much of the table of contents from a

the Netherlands eScience Center, although no actual contents of that
training was used for the development of this material.
